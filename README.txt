Song Sorter by Brooks Chandler, Kieran Parnell, Tyler Schmaling

Our code runs entirely in the command line.

Upon running, a menu will appear that displays general information

First enter either "CATALOG" or "ARTIST" to search either the whole catalog, or the songs of a single artist, respectively.

Then you will be prompted with either another menu displaying searchable attributes or you will be prompted for an artists name

*It is important to note that the artists name should be with the first letter of each word as a capital, ie. The Doors, Pink Floyd

Further more, the program will recognize an artists name from the data even if the user entry is incomplete. ie. "Florence +" will bring up data for "Florence + The Machine"



Thank you for viewing our project!
